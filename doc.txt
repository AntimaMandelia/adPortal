Hi Antima,

Attached the java web service to upload file on remote server.
You have to change in below:
1.	file FileTransfererImpl.java, method: upload() :
-	Change path “d:\\Test2\\" to “/opt/<folder for config.xml>”
-	Trigger deploy.sh file by line> Runtime.getRuntime().exec("cmd /c start /opt/Scripts/deploy.sh");

2.
-	Webserver.java: change below line:
       String bindingURI = "http://localhost:9898/codejava/fileService";
        To line
       String bindingURI = "http://<Virtual Machine Name>:9898/codejava/fileService";

        Run the project by RunAs>Java Application
